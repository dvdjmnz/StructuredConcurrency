            return "This use case shows when we need to perform multiple async tasks when each of them is dependent on the previous one. By using a default approach based on completion we end up facing a multilevel nested logic. On the other hand, with the structured approach, we are able to keep at a single level all the logic."

        case .complexConcurrent:
            return "This use case adds extra complexity to the Concurrent approach, performing different requests by groups."
        case .wrapper:
            return "Just a basic example of how we are able to wrap any async task and migrate them from a completion approach to the structured one."
        case .wrapperWithError:
            return "The same as Wrapper use case but adding error cases"
